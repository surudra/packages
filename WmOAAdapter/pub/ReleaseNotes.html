<HR>

<P>The webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter enables you to integrate with Oracle Applications seamlessly, in real time. With the adapter, you can enable the webMethods Integration Server to retrieve data from, and insert and update data into, Oracle Applications. For example, you can use the Oracle Applications Adapter in a flow that receives an XML-based purchase order and then inserts a sales order into an Oracle Applications system.</p>

<H3>Connectivity to Oracle Applications</H3>

<P>The Oracle Applications Adapter enables you to establish and manage connections to your Oracle Applications systems. The adapter fully manages connections, connection pools, and sessions. Through these connections, you can create and run your Oracle Applications integrations.</P>



<h3>Oracle Applications Transactions</h3>

<p>Oracle Applications is a comprehensive business application that provides many modules and interfaces. The Oracle Applications Adapter enables the Integration Server to execute inbound and outbound transactions on the Oracle Applications modules. The processing for these operations is defined in transaction definitions, which can map to Oracle Applications open interface tables and stored procedures, as well as database views and raw SQL statements. To simplify integration with Oracle Applications, webMethods provides sample transaction definitions that you can use when configuring your adapter services and adapter notifications. You can use the samples as they are provided, or you can modify them for your needs.</p>

<H4>Flexibility for Customizing Transaction Definitions</H4>

<p>Flexibility is an important part of integration, especially with complex systems such as Oracle Applications. If webMethods does not provide the transaction you need, you can use the adapter to create it. The webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 6.0 provides tools and sample transaction definitions that you can use to configure your own inbound and outbound Oracle Applications transactions. You can use the adapter's Transaction Management screens to modify existing transaction definitions or create new transactions, as well as edit and create their corresponding SQL statements. This flexibility facilitates integration with highly customized Oracle Applications. Note: You should have in-depth knowledge and experience with your Oracle Applications system to customize SQL statements.</p>


<H4>Predefined Transaction Services</H4>

<p>For Oracle Applications integrations that are not highly customized, webMethods provides sets of predefined transaction services as add-ons to the webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 6.0. These predefined transaction services are complete, ready-to-use flow services that simplify the process of integrating with Oracle Applications systems. In many cases, all you need to do to use a predefined transaction service is specify your Oracle Applications system connection information. See your webMethods sales representative for information about which sets of predefined transaction services are available.</p>


<H3>Administrative User Interfaces</H3>

<p>Intuitive user interface screens enable you to administer and manage Oracle Applications connections, notifications, and business transaction definitions.</p>


<H3>Template-Based Integrations</H3>

<P>To simplify the process of defining operations for Oracle Application systems, the Oracle Applications Adapter provides templates for configuring adapter services and adapter notifications. Each service template represents a different type of Oracle Applications operation. For example, an Oracle Applications Adapter service that inserts data into an Oracle Applications system is based on the Insert SQL adapter service template.</P>



<h4>Adapter Services</h4>

<P>The Oracle Applications Adapter provides the ability to configure the following types of adapter services listed below. You configure the adapter services using adapter templates and then invoke them from your integration flows.</p>

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Compound Select SQL</TD>
    <TD>Enables the webMethods Integration Server to query an Oracle Applications system and retrieve data based on the query
conditions.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top>Simple SQL</TD>
    <TD>Enables the webMethods Integration Server to be notified of specific events that occur in your Oracle Applications system, and then send data related to the events to trading partners or other enterprise systems.</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>



<h4>Adapter Notifications</h4>

<p>The Oracle Applications Adapter provides polling notifications, which enable the Integration Server to process data from events that occur on an Oracle Applications system. Typically, Oracle Adapter polling notifications are used in combination with database triggers to capture and process events on the Oracle database. You configure adapter notifications using the adapter's polling notification template, and then schedule the notifications to poll your Oracle Applications system on user-defined intervals.</p>


<H3>Compatibility With Previous webMethods Oracle Applications Adapters</H3>

<P>The webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 6.0 is a new adapter and is not compatible with integrations built using the webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 3.0. That is, you cannot use the webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 6.0 to run or edit services you generated using the earlier Oracle Applications adapters, and vice versa. However, the webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 6.0 provides upgrade utilities that enable you to convert your existing Oracle Applications Adapter 3.0 integrations to version 6.0 integrations. See the <i>webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter Installation Guide</i> 6.0 for details.<p>


<H3>Platform Support</H3>

<p>The webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 6.0 supports Oracle Applications versions 10.7SC, 11.0, and 11i.</p>

<p>For a complete list of the required software and hardware, see the <i>webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter Installation Guide</i> 6.0.</p>
