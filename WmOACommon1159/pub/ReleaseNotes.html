<p>The webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 11.5.9 Predefined Transaction Services 6.0 is an add-on product for use with the webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter 6.0 that enables you to easily integrate with a wide range of Oracle Applications modules and interfaces. These predefined transaction services are complete, ready-to-use integration flows. Not only do these flows provide services that operate on Oracle Applications, they also expose required service inputs and outputs and perform required webMethods-to-Oracle Applications/Oracle Applications-to-webMethods document mapping. In many cases, all you need to do to use a predefined transaction service is specify your Oracle Applications system connection information.</p>


<H3>Predefined Oracle Applications Transaction Services</H3>

<p>The webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter provides inbound (webMethods-to-Oracle Applications) and outbound (Oracle Applications-to-webMethods) predefined transaction services.</p>

<P>Predefined inbound transactions provide the following:</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>Required inputs and outputs</li>
    <LI>Mapping and transformation between the business document and Oracle Applications</li>
    <LI>Services that insert data, execute concurrent processes, and perform error handling from webMethods to Oracle Applications</li>
  </UL>

<P>Predefined outbound transactions provide the following:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>A combination of database triggers and polling services for Oracle Applications-to-webMethods notifications</li>
    <LI>Required inputs and outputs</li>
    <LI>Services that lock and unlock the webMethods process table, and perform data selection and acknowledgement from Oracle Applications to webMethods</LI>
  </UL>


<H3>Support for Many Oracle Applications Modules and Interfaces</H3>

<p>The webMethods Oracle Applications Adapter provides over 50 predefined transaction services for Oracle Applications 11.5.9, representing 19 separate Oracle Applications modules. The following table lists and describes the Oracle Applications 11.5.9 predefined transactions:</p>
